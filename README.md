# Google-Classroom-Automization
Google Classroom has no notification of a teacher opening a built-in-app video meeting. This repo is a project made with two good friends to automate the process of checking the Google Classroom page with python.
This project is made using pynput library by Moses-palmer to maintain the cleaness of the code. It also provides easy usage of mouse pointer manipulation and listeners.
